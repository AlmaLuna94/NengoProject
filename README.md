# NengoProject
The file diagLineTest.ipynb is the main file of this repository.
Its purpose is to find the angle of a moving line in an image that is created using a DVS camera or similar. As such the image with the moving line is made up of spiking data. 
It accomplishes this using a SNN (Spiking neural network) library called Nengo.
